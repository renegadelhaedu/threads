<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask.

<h2>Python general availability and new build system</h2>
<p>App Service on Linux introduced expanded Python support a few months ago, and now Python versions 3.7, 3.6 and 2.7 are generally available. Combined with the new build system for App Service on Linux, its easier than ever for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs">Node.js</a> developers to quickly deploy and run their apps on Azure. The new build system automatically resolves package dependencies using yarn or npm for Node.js apps, and pip for Python apps. The build system also supports customizations such as automatically collecting static files for Python apps, as well as running pre and post-build scripts for both Node.js and Python apps. At runtime, App Service on Linux will run Node.js apps with npm start while Python apps run using Gunicorn, including support for WSGI frameworks such as Django and Flask. Find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx">configuration options and available customizations for the new build system</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 11 general availability for both Linux and Windows</h2>
